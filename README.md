# Breeding Time Visualizer
Breeding time visualizer allows it's users to see how much longer until an animal is ready to breed again.  
It does this by outlining animals within a configurable (Default: 5x5)  radius around the player is a color that changes over time.  
The color will change over time from red to green, with green meaning the entity is able to breed.  

There is one config option to allow users to switch from hold to view to toggle view and vice versa.
